###1. Motivation:
The team opted to create a new version of the game based on the original
Chicken Invader game, which was highly well-liked by teens in the previous generation,
because our teamÂ wanted to create something that was relatively fresh and did not overlap
with the projects of the other groups.

Due to the fact that we are redesigning a game that has already become popular, our team has made certain adjustments
to the visuals and themes to prevent gamers from becoming disinterested while playing the game. In order to make this
game more replayable, we also planned to develop the game with a roguelike map so that players can replay the game with
a different route to explore different challenges.

###2. Topic:
This game takes the theme of the player's ship, which is an anti-virus software that is installed on a computer to be
able to clean up the viruses that are destroying the software and components inside. To be able to win the user needs to
control the spaceship and destroy all the enemies and the final boss.

###3. Technologies:
* Programming language: Java
* Framework: libGDX

##Work Distribution

The division of work took a little longer than expected compared to the original schedule because the group was formed
much later than the common ground. To ensure that everyone can finish the submission on time and that the schedule can
be compressed to meet the deadlines, this work is still distributed equally among team members.
